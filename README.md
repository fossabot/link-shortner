This project uses a Graphcool service. Visit [Graphcool](http://graph.cool) to
sign-up and get a free account. To get started, install the Graphcool CLI first,
login and then deploy the Graphcool service:

```
cd graphcool

# Login to graphcool
graphcool login

# Deploy the graphcool service
graphcool deploy

# Get the API URLs
graphcool info
```

Next, paste the Simple and Subscriptions API URLs to index.js.

### Run the project

After you've set up Graphcool and pasted the Simple and Subscriptions API URLs
to index.js, you can run `yarn start` to start the website.
